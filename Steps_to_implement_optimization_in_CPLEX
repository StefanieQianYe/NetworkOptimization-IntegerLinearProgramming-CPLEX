Below procedure shows how to implement the optimization in CPLEX:

STEP 1: Create a text file describing the problem (An example is provided in the file named "CPLEX_code.lp").

STEP 2: Start the CPLEX interactive system (cplex.exe).

STEP 3: Set up the directory of log file that records all work information. 
Command: set log D:\your local folder\your file name.txt, then press Enter

STEP 4: Read the problem file created in STEP 1. 
Command: Read filename.txt (drag the file into CPLEX), then press Enter

STEP 5: Specify the problem type (e.g., “lp” for linear programming) 
Command: lp, then press Enter

STEP 6: Solve the optimization problem. 
Command: opt, then press Enter

STEP 7: Display solution for all variables. 
Command: dis so va -, then press Enter

STEP 8: Quit CPLEX. 
Command: quit, then press Enter

STEP 9: Check solution results in the log file as created in STEP 3.
